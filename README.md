# Scrape.ai

## What is **scrape.ai**?

**scrape.ai** is a Google Chrome extension that allows its users to pull useful information from a page without any hassle. 

In a nutshell, the user enters a query in the form of a relevant question on the extension, and (on average) receives a response in under ten seconds, i.e. if a user is looking for the content of fat of Tesco’s butter chicken, they can query the extension on the product page of Tesco's website and receive the fat content of the product in grams.
